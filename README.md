### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### :technologist: About Me :
<p>
Hello! My name is Muse Intira V. and I am excited to share my experiences and background with you.

Firstly, I did not complete a university degree, but I have always been a self-learner. I have always been passionate about learning new things and acquiring new skills. This drive to learn has led me to the world of coding, which I absolutely love.

I am particularly drawn to coding because it allows me to be creative and to build things from scratch. The feeling of seeing my code come to life is incredibly satisfying. I am constantly challenging myself to learn new coding languages and to create more complex programs.

One of the things I enjoy most about learning is the challenge of stepping outside of my comfort zone. I believe that the best way to grow and develop new skills is to take on challenges that are outside of my current abilities. This mindset has helped me to develop a strong sense of perseverance and determination, which has been invaluable in my coding journey.

I am also a firm believer in the power of experience. Learning from mistakes and failures has helped me to grow and develop as a coder. I am always willing to try new things and to take risks, knowing that failure is an opportunity to learn and improve.

In conclusion, my passion for coding and my commitment to self-learning have led me to a fulfilling career in tech. I believe that learning is a lifelong process, and I am excited to continue developing my skills and knowledge in the field of coding.
